            Andhra Pradesh  is a state in the south-eastern coastal region of India.
           It is the seventh-largest state by area covering an area of 162,975 km2 (62,925 sq mi)[4] and
         tenth-most populous state with 49,386,799 inhabitants,[13][14] with the state capital being Amaravati.[15] 
         It is bordered by Telangana to the north-west, Chhattisgarh to the north, Odisha to the north-east, 
        Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the west and the Bay of Bengal to the east.[16] 
        It has the second longest coastline in India after Gujarat, of about 974 km (605 mi).[17] 
       Andhra State was the first state to be formed on a linguistic basis in India on 1 October 1953.[18] 
     On 1 November 1956, Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking areas of the Hyderabad State to form Andhra Pradesh.
         The state was then reorganised in June 2014 to form a separate Telangana state.
